Do I really need a hammer to move a couch?
I wish I could move this desk, but I haven't taken any carpentry classes!

This mod removes the nails holding your furniture and appliances to the floor!

Details:
- Furniture and appliances require no skill/tool to move.
- Fixtures like cabinets and shelves still require skills/tools.
- Break chance for props requiring skills/tools has been reduced to 30% at skill level 0, 20% at 1, 10% at 2, and 0% for >=3.
- Break chance for props not requiring skills/tools is now 0%.
- Sinks in vanilla have no associated skill and receive a 25% break chance default. Changed to 0% since apparently no skill is required!
- All the above only applies to "pickup" and "place" actions. Disassembly should not be affected by this mod.

The mod works by "whitelisting" props if their name matches certain patterns. This implies that the patterns may catch too much or too little, so feel free to provide feedback if you think some props should or should not require a skill/tool.

Disclaimer: There could be big bugs in this mod! The vanilla lua code has numerous edge cases, please comment if you discover issues.

Game Version:
This mod is designed for the latest non-beta version of the game; that is, "None" should be selected under the game's "betas" properties. I update it every now and then when bugs appear with later game versions.
There's a special mod for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2776348490]version 41.65[/url], made upon request.
